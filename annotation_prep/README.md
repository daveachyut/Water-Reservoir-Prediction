## Running Annotation Prep

## Annotating
Annotation was done using Labelbox (https://labelbox.com/). It provides a fairly simple interface and allows you to export masks for the annotations.
prep_labelbox_csv.sh will upload the image patchs for annotation and prepare a CSV that you can use to create a new project on Labelbox.
